got the tweets back to jan 20 or so --- so perhaps use this:

http://www.curiositybits.com/new-page-2/

to go back and get the rest by setting the date to a limit?? or using the tweet id?


#next step is to take twitter2.py and make it for a users tweets..or timeline..
ie go to the api twitter page to grab that, test, then
try to make the sql table set up? and avoid duplicates, the old code might
be helpful, or modify the old code..
